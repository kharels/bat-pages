- Ask questions. Only stupid question is the one that isn't asked.
- spend time upfront determining the effort and business value it provides.
- Not all asks are high priority. Assess the importance and value upfront.

## Proactive but prepared to react
- Need to cultivate culture of solving BIG problems before they occur.
- Let data guide you (observablity, capacity, etc )
- Automation is your best friend
- With this, when you have to react, your reaction time will be much faster
## Continuous Learning
- **How did people work before search engine?** (or Stack Overflow, ChatGPT)
- In tech the only thing constant is change
- Abundance of resources at our fingertips
