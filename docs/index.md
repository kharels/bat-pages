# History
- Changes pushed twice a week
- Spend weeks writing code before deploying it
- painful merges
- Devs handed off the code to deployers 
- Lots of outages followed deployment
- Teams were siloed, and things moved at very slow pace
- Oh, there is rollback..
- Never mind, the change never made it to production. 
- Used home grown deployment tool called 'Sprouter'

# Change is inevitable
- In 2009, Etsy adopted DevOps, and since has been great example of methodology since
- It took them 2 years to reach steady state and derive value from investment
- Now they deploy more than 50 times a day

# How did they get there
- Started with monitoring, and stablizing sites
- automated DB upgrades
- implemented continuous deployment
- Developed 'Try'(Open Source) for testing their changes in Jenkins
- Developed 'Deployinator'(Open Source) for deployment orchestration
- investment in prod like staging environment, where all test happened
- Config flags were integral part of deployment
- Continuous monitoring

# Lessons to learn
- It's not about doing it all at once or doing it right the first time.
- Invest in open source
- Enable your people, break silos, cross train.
- And don't forget DevOps is Journey NOT destination
